title: Webcast and videos to learn about Azure
excerpt: During the last few weeks I have done a few workshops and trainings about the Windows Azure Platform all across Austria. For those people who could not attend I have put together some important dates for webcasts in which you can learn about Windows Azure. Additionally I would like to point you to a webcast recording about getting started with the Windows Azure November 2010 release.
