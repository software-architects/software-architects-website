<p>On Thursday I will do three sessions about the Microsoft Windows Azure platform at the <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/germany" target="_blank">DevConnections conference</a> in Karlsruhe (Germany). Here are the abstracts that show what I am going to present in these sessions.</p><h2>10 Things You Can Do to Use Windows Azure More Effectively</h2><p>Abstract:</p><p>
  <em>You are already using Windows Azure or you are planning to take the step into the cloud? In this session Rainer Stropek, MVP for Windows Azure, presents some of the most important tips to get the most out of your investment in Microsoft’s cloud computing platform. Did you know that you can host multiple websites in a single Azure web role? Rainer will cover things like this during his session. You will learn about the theory behind them and see them presented in practical examples.</em>

  <em>Windows Azure is just another hosting platform. You can only run .NET in Windows Azure. No unmanaged code in Azure. If you need non-Microsoft components in Azure you have to use VM-Role. Rumors like this are wide-spread in the developer community – and they are all WRONG! Join Rainer Stropek in a session where he will point out some of the most talked-about myths about the Windows Azure Platform. You will definitively leave with a clearer understanding about what Azure really offers to developers like you.</em>

  <em>Mit ODATA hat Microsoft ein Datenaustauschformat vorgestellt, das sich immer mehr zum Quasistandard vorarbeitet. ODATA = SOA ohne dem Overhead von SOAP. Es stehen mittlerweile Implementierungen auf verschiedenen Plattformen zur Verfügung. In dieser Session zeigt Rainer Stropek die Entwicklung individueller ODATA Provider, über die man eigene Datenstrukturen im ODATA Format zugänglich machen kann.</em>
