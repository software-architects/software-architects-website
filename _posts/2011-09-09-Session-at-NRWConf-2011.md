<p>Like last year Rainer Stropek presents at <a href="http://www.nrwconf.de/" target="_blank">NRWConf</a> in Wuppertal. In his session Rainer speaks about <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a> und he demonstrates <a href="http://www.timecockpit.com/" target="_blank">time cockpit</a> at a booth and during a lunch session. Here is a short abstract about the content of Rainer's session:</p><h2>Windows Server Rest in Peace</h2><p>
  <em>Ever asked yourself why Cloud Computing is considered a „disruptive technology“? Come and join Rainer Stropek in this session ans see, why Windows Azure is so fundamentaly different than everything you used to know from your on-premise data center. Network, servers, load balancers, fabric, CDN – after the session you will have a clear understanding about Microsoft‘s „operating system for the cloud“.  </em>
