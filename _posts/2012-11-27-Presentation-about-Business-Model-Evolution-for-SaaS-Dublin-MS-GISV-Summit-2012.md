<p>It is a pleasure for me to be a speaker at Microsoft EMEA's Global ISV Summit again. Last year the event took place in Bratislava. I was speaking about consequences of multi-tenancy on software architectures. This year I cover two topics. The first one is very business-oriented. I speak about typical challenges that software vendors have to solve to successfully transfer from the classical licensing-based model to a SaaS strategy. In this blog article I publish my slides. You can view them on slideshare or <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/images/blog/2012/11/Business model evolution - why the journey to SaaS makes sense.pdf" target="_blank">download them in PDF format</a>.</p><p>Note that the original slide deck contains quite a lot of animations. If you want to have the original PPTX file including all the animations, feel free to contact me <a href="mailto:rainer@timecockpit.com" target="_blank">via email</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/rstropek" target="_blank">twitter</a> (@rstropek). </p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15369672?rel=0" width="512" height="421" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px" data-mce-style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
