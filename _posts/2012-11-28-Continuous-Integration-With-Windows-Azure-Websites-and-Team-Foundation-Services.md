<p>Windows Azure Websites (WAWS) is a great PaaS service in Microsoft's Cloud Computing platform Windows Azure. It makes it very easy to create, run, and scale web sites or web APIs. The new Team Foundation Services integrate perfectly with WAWS and make it possible to setup a continuous integration environment in the cloud within minutes. Tomorrow I will be speaker at the German TeamConf conference in Munich. I will show continuous integration with WAWS and Team Foundation Services. In this article I publish my slides and a video with a summary of my demo.</p><h2>Video With Sample</h2><iframe width="640" height="480" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/CiUscpaKUhI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2>Slides</h2><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15395374?rel=0" width="512" height="421" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" webkitallowfullscreen="webkitallowfullscreen" mozallowfullscreen="mozallowfullscreen"></iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px" data-mce-style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
