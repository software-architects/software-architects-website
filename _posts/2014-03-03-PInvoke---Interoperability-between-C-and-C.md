<p>Because of a C# training I had to do recently, I took my existing PInvoke material and brought it up to date. Here are the slides and samples. The material covers the following topics:</p><ol>
  <li>C++ basics (e.g. how to debug C++ and C# in a single project?)</li>
  <li>Interop basics (<em>DllImport</em>, simple data types, <em>Marshal</em> class, character sets, etc.)</li>
  <li>Manual marshaling (<em>IntPtr</em>, C# <em>unsafe</em> code, fixed buffers, etc.)</li>
  <li>Advanced marshaling topics (e.g. arrays, callbacks, manual memory management, etc.)</li>
</ol><p class="showcase">The samples have also been refreshed and I have put them into my <a href="https://github.com/rstropek/Samples/tree/master/PInvoke" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.</p><h2>Slides</h2><p>You can view the slides here. If you prefer having them as PDF, you can <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/content/images/blog/2014/03/PInvoke.pdf" target="_blank">download them here</a>.</p><iframe src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/31856102?rel=0" width="512" height="421" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px 1px 0; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><div style="margin-bottom:5px">
