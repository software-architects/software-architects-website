<p>REST is a great standard for accessing resources on the web. However, REST is also a very generic standard. If you want to publish REST-based web services for accessing a structured data store like a relational database, you will end up inventing you own custom protocols on top of REST. Enter <a href="http://www.odata.org" target="_blank">OData</a>. OData is based on REST but adds necessary standards for fully fledged data APIs. Metadata, URI-based query language, standardized data representation formats (JSON and XML), OData has it all.</p><p>This video is a recording of a talk that Azure MVP Rainer Stropek gave at the <a href="http://phpconference.com/2014se/en/special-days/javascript-day" target="_blank">JavaScript Day on the International PHP Conference</a> in Berlin 2014. In his talk, Rainer introduces you to the OData standard. He shows how to build OData services with .NET and how to consume them. Rainer also demonstrates existing, large-scale OData services available in the cloud.</p><p class="showcase">Did you know that our own product time cockpit offers a great OData implementation, too? You can get a trial account on <a href="~/create-trial-account" target="_blank">our homepage</a>.</p><p>Note that this is an introduction to OData. If you have never used OData and you wonder whether it is relevant for you, this talk could be interesting for you.
