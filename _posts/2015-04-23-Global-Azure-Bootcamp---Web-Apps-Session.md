    <em>In my opinion, Azure Websites is one of the top services that Microsoft added to their cloud. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a Node.JS, PHP, ASP.NET developer, with Azure Websites you get a great runtime environment for your products. In this demo-only session, Azure MVP Rainer Stropek introduces you to Azure Websites using multiple examples. Rainer starts with the basics: Just some HTML- and JavaScript files. Next, he extends the sample using a Node.JS backend. You will learn how to deploy such a solution using Git. Finally, Rainer shows how to use C#, ASP.NET, and Visual Studio to implement and deploy more advanced backend logic.</em>
