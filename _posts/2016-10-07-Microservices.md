excerpt: In software architecture workshops I regularly discuss the concept of Microservices with customers. In this blog article I share the slide deck that I use for that. Sometimes I use it to present the concept of Microservices to customers who are not familiar with it. Sometimes I only hand it out because of the reference links included in the slides. Hope you find the presentation interesting.

## Introduction

In software architecture workshops I regularly discuss the concept of Microservices with customers. In this blog article I share the slide deck that I use for that. Sometimes I use it to present the concept of Microservices to customers who are not familiar with it. Sometimes I only hand it out because of the reference links included in the slides. Hope you find the presentation interesting.
