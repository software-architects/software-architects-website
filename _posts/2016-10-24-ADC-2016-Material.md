## Introduction

At this year's Advanced Developer Conference (ADC) in Germany, I did the vision keynote and a session about Azure Active Directory B2C. The keynote was about the future of enterprise software development. In this blog article I publish the material for my talks including all slides.


## Vision Keynote: Future of Enterprise Software Development

In my keynote, I talked about the future of enterprise software development. I started by talking about important changes taking place in the industry. Next, I talked about how this influences developers working with Microsoft's technology stack. My keynote closed with tips and suggestions about organizational transformations necessary to embrace modern approaches like DevOps and Microservices.
