# Introduction

September is [BASTA!](https://basta.net) time. It has become a beloved tradition for me to travel in Autumn to Mainz to speak at the [BASTA!](https://basta.net) conference. This year, my workshop/session/keynote topics were .NET, microservices and web dev technology. In this blog post I share my session material and recordings.


# Professional C# Workshop

On Monday, I did a full-day workshop about .NET and C#. I have been doing this workshop for many years now. Each year, I try to focus on those topics that are currently on the top of people's minds. With that, I make sure that people will come back and visit my workshop next year, too ;-)

This year's focus topics were .NET Core 2.0, migration from .NET Framework to .NET Core and .NET microservices. Of course, I also covered news in the C# language.

## Samples

You can find my samples about .NET Core in [my GitHub *Samples* repository](https://github.com/rstropek/Samples/tree/master/AspNetCoreWorkshop). The C# 7 samples are in [this folder](https://github.com/rstropek/Samples/tree/master/CSharp7). The slides are [also on GitHub](https://github.com/rstropek/Samples/raw/master/AspNetCoreWorkshop/Slides/BASTA%202017%20-%20CSharp%20Workshop%20-%20Rainer%20Stropek.pdf).
