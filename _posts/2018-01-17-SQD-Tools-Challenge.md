## Winner Winner Chicken Dinner

Today, I had the honor to represent Microsoft at the Tools Challenge of the Software Quality Days 2018 in Vienna. The audience voted - **and we won :-)**

In this year's Tools Challenge, four major vendors of software quality-related tools were invited to "battle":

* Micro Focus
* CA Technologies
* Tricentis
* Microsoft

The questions we had to answer within 12 minutes were:

1. What challenges do you see in software quality in the next 1-5 years?
1. How do you prepare for the challenges?

I really enjoyed the event because having to talk about such a broad topic within 12 minutes is in fact a real challenge.
