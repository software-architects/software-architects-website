## Introduction

Today, I did a talk at the DevOne conference in Linz. My topic was ASP.NET Core Blazor. In 30 minutes, I had to give the audience an idea, what Blazor is capable of doing. In this post, I share the material I used in my session.

## Sources

You can find the source code of my demo [on GitHub](https://github.com/rstropek/StarshipTraveler).
